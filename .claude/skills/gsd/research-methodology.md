# Research Methodology

Shared principles, tool strategies, and verification protocols for all GSD research agents.

## Philosophy

### Claude's Training as Hypothesis

Claude's training data is 6-18 months stale. Treat pre-existing knowledge as hypothesis, not fact.

**The trap:** Claude "knows" things confidently. But that knowledge may be:
- Outdated (library has new major version)
- Incomplete (feature was added after training)
- Wrong (Claude misremembered or hallucinated)

**The discipline:**
1. **Verify before asserting** - Don't state library capabilities without checking Context7 or official docs
2. **Date your knowledge** - "As of my training" is a warning flag, not a confidence marker
3. **Prefer current sources** - Context7 and official docs trump training data
4. **Flag uncertainty** - LOW confidence when only training data supports a claim

### Honest Reporting

Research value comes from accuracy, not completeness theater.

**Report honestly:**
- "I couldn't find X" is valuable (now we know to investigate differently)
- "This is LOW confidence" is valuable (flags for validation)
- "Sources contradict" is valuable (surfaces real ambiguity)
- "I don't know" is valuable (prevents false confidence)

**Avoid:**
- Padding findings to look complete
- Stating unverified claims as facts
- Hiding uncertainty behind confident language
- Pretending WebSearch results are authoritative

### Research is Investigation, Not Confirmation

**Bad research:** Start with hypothesis, find evidence to support it
**Good research:** Gather evidence, form conclusions from evidence

When researching "best library for X":
- Don't find articles supporting your initial guess
- Find what the ecosystem actually uses
- Document tradeoffs honestly
- Let evidence drive recommendation

## Tool Strategy

### Context7: First for Libraries

Context7 provides authoritative, current documentation for libraries and frameworks.

**When to use:**
- Any question about a library's API
- How to use a framework feature
- Current version capabilities
- Configuration options

**How to use:**
```
1. Resolve library ID:
   mcp__context7__resolve-library-id with libraryName: "[library name]"

2. Query documentation:
   mcp__context7__query-docs with:
   - libraryId: [resolved ID]
   - query: "[specific question]"
```

**Best practices:**
- Resolve first, then query (don't guess IDs)
- Use specific queries for focused results
- Query multiple topics if needed (getting started, API, configuration)
- Trust Context7 over training data

### Official Docs via WebFetch

For libraries not in Context7 or for authoritative sources.

**When to use:**
- Library not in Context7
- Need to verify changelog/release notes
- Official blog posts or announcements
- GitHub README or wiki

**How to use:**
```
WebFetch with exact URL:
- https://docs.library.com/getting-started
- https://github.com/org/repo/releases
- https://official-blog.com/announcement
```

**Best practices:**
- Use exact URLs, not search results pages
- Check publication dates
- Prefer /docs/ paths over marketing pages
- Fetch multiple pages if needed

### WebSearch: Ecosystem Discovery

For finding what exists, community patterns, real-world usage.

**When to use:**
- "What libraries exist for X?"
- "How do people solve Y?"
- "Common mistakes with Z"
- Ecosystem surveys

**Query templates:**
```
Ecosystem discovery:
- "[technology] best practices [current year]"
- "[technology] recommended libraries [current year]"
- "[technology] vs [alternative] [current year]"

Pattern discovery:
- "how to build [type of thing] with [technology]"
- "[technology] project structure"
- "[technology] architecture patterns"

Problem discovery:
- "[technology] common mistakes"
- "[technology] performance issues"
- "[technology] gotchas"
```

**Best practices:**
- Always include the current year (check today's date) for freshness
- Use multiple query variations
- Cross-verify findings with authoritative sources
- Mark WebSearch-only findings as LOW confidence

### Verification Protocol

**CRITICAL:** WebSearch findings must be verified.

```
For each WebSearch finding:

1. Can I verify with Context7?
   YES → Query Context7, upgrade to HIGH confidence
   NO → Continue to step 2

2. Can I verify with official docs?
   YES → WebFetch official source, upgrade to MEDIUM confidence
   NO → Remains LOW confidence, flag for validation

3. Do multiple sources agree?
   YES → Increase confidence one level
   NO → Note contradiction, investigate further
```

**Never present LOW confidence findings as authoritative.**

## Source Hierarchy

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Sources | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| HIGH | Context7, official documentation, official releases | State as fact |
| MEDIUM | WebSearch verified with official source, multiple credible sources agree | State with attribution |
| LOW | WebSearch only, single source, unverified | Flag as needing validation |

### Source Prioritization

**1. Context7 (highest priority)**
- Current, authoritative documentation
- Library-specific, version-aware
- Trust completely for API/feature questions

**2. Official Documentation**
- Authoritative but may require WebFetch
- Check for version relevance
- Trust for configuration, patterns

**3. Official GitHub**
- README, releases, changelogs
- Issue discussions (for known problems)
- Examples in /examples directory

**4. WebSearch (verified)**
- Community patterns confirmed with official source
- Multiple credible sources agreeing
- Recent (include year in search)

**5. WebSearch (unverified)**
- Single blog post
- Stack Overflow without official verification
- Community discussions
- Mark as LOW confidence

## Verification Protocol

### Known Pitfalls

Patterns that lead to incorrect research conclusions.

#### Configuration Scope Blindness

**Trap:** Assuming global configuration means no project-scoping exists
**Prevention:** Verify ALL configuration scopes (global, project, local, workspace)

#### Deprecated Features

**Trap:** Finding old documentation and concluding feature doesn't exist
**Prevention:**
- Check current official documentation
- Review changelog for recent updates
- Verify version numbers and publication dates

#### Negative Claims Without Evidence

**Trap:** Making definitive "X is not possible" statements without official verification
**Prevention:** For any negative claim:
- Is this verified by official documentation stating it explicitly?
- Have you checked for recent updates?
- Are you confusing "didn't find it" with "doesn't exist"?

#### Single Source Reliance

**Trap:** Relying on a single source for critical claims
**Prevention:** Require multiple sources for critical claims:
- Official documentation (primary)
- Release notes (for currency)
- Additional authoritative source (verification)

### Quick Reference Checklist

Before submitting research:

- [ ] All domains investigated (stack, patterns, pitfalls)
- [ ] Negative claims verified with official docs
- [ ] Multiple sources cross-referenced for critical claims
- [ ] URLs provided for authoritative sources
- [ ] Publication dates checked (prefer recent/current)
- [ ] Confidence levels assigned honestly
- [ ] "What might I have missed?" review completed
